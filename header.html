         <h4>HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION</h4>
         <p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR), Is a machine learning web application designed to detect falls in real-time and trigger an alert.
             <b>HAR's centre focus for the duration of the project was using convolutional neural networks as a means to detect falls but this proved unsuccessful.
             </b>
             <b>Furthermore, it was in the end proven that HAAR Cascade Classifier would be more feasible at detecting the fall. This was the approach which was adopted from a multitude of sources to detect the fall.</b>
         </p>

             Human Activity Recognition is aimed at contributing to the betterment of an ageing Irish population through effective fall detection, 
             <br> which contributes to the attributes of independence, safety and comfort. Removing the need to wear sensors enables a feeling of independence from technology and allows you to move on with your day.
             <br>It also feels more comfortable. Finally, the detection algorithm should be performant enough to safeguard in falls and guarantee a high degree of prediction capability. However this may not be the end product.
             <br> harnessing methods such as supervised deep learning - Convolutional Neural Networks extending to other Classification madlities such as rapid object boost detection,
         during this moments the one and the only question you will hear is:
             <br><br>also known as HAAR Cascade Classifier, which gained prominence in 2001 after a paper was published on its effectiveness by Paul Viola.
